# CitiBike Analysis with Tableau

## I. Project Overview

### Background

Kate traveled to NYC last summer and enjoyed riding CitiBike everywhere, which allowed her to really get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and who are using bikes for their communities. 

A gem of an idea starts to form in her mind. What if she could start a similar Bike Share business for her hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. I have been helping Kate to brainstorm, and with support from a potential investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike share program in Des Moines.

For the first step, we have decided to figure out how the Bikeshare business actually works in New York City. From there, we will have a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. Since I have data analysis experience, I will conduct a thorough analysis on CitiBike data from August 2019 and visualize the result using Tableau. 

### Purposes

The purpose of this analysis is to get a deep understanding of NYC CitiBike data and created a solid business proposal to convince investors that a Bikesharing program in Des Moines.

For this analysis, I have used Pandas to clean the data, then created set of visualizations story using Tableau.

**The analysis includes:**
  1.	The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  2.	The length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.
  3.	The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
  4.	The number of bike trips for each type of gender for each day of the week.
  5.	The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  6.	Top starting and ending stations for all users on maps.
  7.	Average trip duration by ages.

**In Summary section, I will also provide two further analysis recommendations.**
1.	Top 20 stationsâ€™ ID and names.
2.	Starting and ending stations by user type.
